## Replace API Key and Integration ID

In order to use the app with the actual API, you need to replace the placeholder values for `apiKey` and `integrationId` with the original values provided by your API provider.

1. Open the `PaymentPage.js` file in your project.

2. Locate the following lines:
   ```javascript
   const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
   const integrationId = 'YOUR_INTEGRATION_ID';
